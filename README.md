- Detect unreported inventory theft, financial variances, and low-performing products.
- Forecast demand and optimize inventory levels.
- Propose strategies like dynamic pricing, product bundling, and promotional campaigns.
- Deliver data-driven insights for actionable decision-making.

## Data Description
- **Source:** Vendorâ€™s daily sales and inventory records.
- **Format:** Excel spreadsheets (CSV/XLSX).
- **Key Columns:**
  - Transaction date
  - Product details (name, category)
  - Quantity sold
  - Unit price & total amount
  - Inventory levels
  - Customer purchase details (for Market Basket Analysis)

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handled missing values and discrepancies.
   - Standardized product identifiers and date formats.
   - Conducted **data reconciliation** to detect financial variances and inventory issues.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
